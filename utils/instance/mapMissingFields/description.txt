There are three types: definition, slave and master.

The goal is that the definition contains everything the system might be interested in.
The slave extends the definition and can restrict it to only fields that the system MUST persist.
The master extends the slave and can restrict it to only fields that the system MAY update.

This means the definition might create fields that the target system can not modify nor persist. These fields however might influence behavior (if A == B, then do something slightly different) that it might not be able to reproduce in the slave document.

This also means, if we do a PULL, we can only reconstruct the slave fields (presumably). This might leave a gap for fields that exist in the definition but not in the slave, they will be null. This might cause issues downstream.
For this reason, we compare the fields from the definition to the output of the pull to see if there is anything missing and fetch that from the cdm instance.
