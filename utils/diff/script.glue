# Array diffing is tricky

# When we can't, we assume that any change to the array prompts the switch of the entire array rather than trying to pinpoint the exact field that was changed
# E.g. insert contacts[1] is tricky to know if you want to apply it to a particular system because there is no way to know if the contact already exists
# Same when we do update contacts[1]/firstName, we have no way of knowing whether we are updating the correct contact
# For simple enough arrays (e.g. opening hours, listings of masterdata etc), it is enough that we simply change the entire array
# For complex usecases (e.g. addresses, contacts,...) we assume you have enough data to assign a primary key that can be used to target the correct instance
