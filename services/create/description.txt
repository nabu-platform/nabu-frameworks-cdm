Create a new instance of a cdm. You need to provide _some_ external ids, otherwise none of the systems will have an idea what needs to be done.


We will create a new instance of the object, fill in a newly generated primary key field and enrich it from remote systems.
You can provide external ids so your particular enricher can perform the basic enrichment necessary


We don't want to make a big deal out of primary keys anymore, if they are relevant: report them as external id!
